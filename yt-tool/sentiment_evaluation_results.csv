"*[For those wandering why ls command is not found in Windows Command Prompt]*
Yes, `ls` is a Unix command / utility which is not available in Windows Command Prompt _by default_ (it is though available in PowerShell terminal as an _alias_ for Get-ChildItem command).
So most probably the author has Git for Windows installed with the option of adding Unix tools (ls is also there) to the Path (this option is offered during the Git for Windows installation).",Neutral,Positive,False

"Federer has 12.8 million followers, with most of Switzerland's 9 million being his fans. Nadal has 21.8 million, with Spain having 50 million. Djokovic has 15.6 million, while Serbia has 6.5 million. LOL. Federer's big following is because so many are from his own country. Djokovic has the lowest ratio of fans from his country, while Nadal has the highest. He's not a popular star, he's a population star. Federer has far fewer followers than Djokovic; shouldn't he be less popular? LOL. It's just Swiss PR and his hooked nose and jutting chin are being praised as classy when he gets wrinkles. Have you seen Federer when he was young? He's not great now either. Go look. They call it classy because of PR so he gets advertising deals. By your logic, a celebrity who's good at tennis and gets ads is the world number 1? LOL. Djokovic has more than double the followers than his own small country, plus looks, skill, and everything is better. Nadal has so many people in his country. It's less than half. Instagram has 5.5 billion downloads, most in their country must have it, not a really old population like Korea. But less than half are following him. Federer is not better at anything. Federer should get an Olympic gold and Nadal should win at least one finals title. Both are only good at one type of surface. Both have bad records against Djokovic. How hard is it to win everything like Djokovic, maintaining an 80% win rate on every surface? Don't call him the goat LOL. Djokovic is the only tennis player to win every single title - ATP 1000 masters, ATP finals, 4 major grand slams, Olympic gold and have 80% win rates across all courts. Nadal is at 77% on hard courts, and Federer is at 76% on clay. LOL. Djokovic has more of the biggest titles compared to others - ATP 1000 series, finals, Olympic singles, and grand slams. Djokovic has the most finals wins, the most ATP 1000 masters, and the most grand slam wins. The total big title wins are Djokovic with 72, Nadal with 59, and Federer with 54. LOL. Why the huge difference? Blame your master for only playing ATP 500 and 250. Djokovic has played in more big title games =only with the best players. His win rate is 84%, while Nadal is at 82.8% and Federer is at 81.9%. That's enough. Federer the king of ATP 250 LOL. Why? Because he's weak in big tournaments. Numbers tell it all. Djokovic barely plays 250s. Unlike Federer who loves those, maybe once or twice a year. Federer has won 1245 games but his big titles are ...he's the king of ATP 250s. If Djokovic only played 250-500 like your idol, he would have easily won 200 tournaments. Blame your idols who only play those small tournaments and have very similar tournament win rates. Nadal also only plays the clay 250-500 tournaments, and during seasons without clay, he travels far away to South America or other countries with 250 tournaments. During hard and grass seasons, Nadal quits in the early stages of 1000 series tournaments and goes to the 250-500 to be happy with those wins LOL. It's well-known. Why does Federer have such low win rates when he's mostly been winning 250-500 from a young age? He won more than half his titles in 250-500. Djokovic won 2/3 of his titles in big tournaments. Among 250 and 500, 500 is more frequent. LOL I watched you praise this guy and now you're going even crazier. Save face if you don't want to become more pathetic.",Negative,Positive,False

"I love how people are still confused when I keep saying that a few hundred million here or there is absolutely nothing in war; people need to start telling congress to get off their asses and do MORE than just $750M. $750M is NOTHING; it takes WAY over a trillion to even remotely hope to equip a competent fighting force capable of repelling Russia. Russia is still fully capable of turning this war around- a push down from Belarus along the Polish border would capitulate Ukraine, for example. We need to be coordinating NATO to be sending AT MINIMUM $10 billion per month... RIGHT NOW.

What we NEED to do right now is:
1) Give Ukraine a blank check for military aid. Anything they want to buy we buy it for them. This can take the form of an official NATO blank check and that would probably be preferable. This serves the strategic importance of no longer needing to run to congress for every minor approval AND better conceals the weapons systems we're sending.
2) Begin forming the ""Marshall Plan"" for Ukraine. We must announce to the world that Ukraine is going to win by laying the ground work for the reconstruction era. This serves two MAJOR strategic matters of importance: one- nations will be FAR more willing to give their weapons to Ukraine. Two- securing the future security of Europe by turning Ukraine into staunch allies that would never succumb to revolution.",Positive,Positive,True

Every single man that's killed in Ukraine the Russians had to train. Each Soldier had to be raised from infant to 18 and then go on to training with the military. We never think of this kind of cost the outlay in money that is invested in these young men and women who are then put into tanks that are older than they are and expect them to go up against weaponry of the 21st Century. Putin is trying to win this war on the cheap he's throwing away lives he's clearing out all the old military equipment that's been standing around for 60 years and he's expecting his military to come up with a miracle. How can you expect that when the soldiers don't even know where they are if they don't know where they are or why they are there how do you expect them to fight for the goals of the nation. Once again Putin has fallen back on the Great dictatorship two-step. He gets into power and things start to go wrong people start not liking him much. So what does the dictator do he starts a war. Wars don't generally go very well and they are extremely expensive. But they had better wake up and see how much money that they put into these men and women and have them killed so easily. Russian army was once something to be feared it's a huge Army now Putin's turned it into a joke and a very expensive one this is a tragedy on a scale that is beyond comprehension.,Negative,Neutral,False

Only 7% of black voters vote Republican.

Shapiro is a multi-millionaire.
He is only trying to protect himself.
Less than 2,000 Americans control nearly 40% of our nation's wealth and we keep giving them more and more tax breaks.
Minimum wage hasn't gone up in 30 years but the salaries of corporate CEOs has increased more than 1500%. 1500%!!
A person with a minimum wage job can't even support themselves anymore, but the wealthiest Americans are the ones getting the tax breaks.

"In examining the data provided by a television broadcast of some time ago conducted by the journalist Formigli, on ""La 7"", I saw something in a graph that contrasts with the official narrative provided by public institutions and the press throughout the world on handling the Covid-19 epidemic.

In the graph, many countries were compared in terms of deaths from Covid for million inhabitants, including two neighboring countries, namely Brazil and Argentina. As you know, Bolsonaro, president of Brazil, was harshly criticized for refusing to subject the population to lockdowns and other restrictive measures to fight the virus, contrary to what did instead Fernandez, President of Argentina, who, in addition to an eight-month lockdown, has imposed restrictions and impositions of all kinds on the population, with serious consequences for the economy of that country. The comparison that emerges from the graph is therefore surprising:

1) Brazil - Covid deaths per million inhabitants = 786
2) Argentina - Covid deaths per million inhabitants = 801

First of all, I note that the data contrasts with what was disseminated by the media around the world, namely the thousands of deaths that were attributed to Bolsonaro for not having adopted the anticovid measures advocated by the more ""advanced"" countries against the virus, which instead in the graph, they appear even lower than those of a neighboring country like Argentina, which had instead adopted all the restrictive anticovid measures.

Some even replied with a 'birthday wishes' Python program.  I have tried many times to like all the replies, but as I continue to click 'Review replies', YouTube eventually reloads.  I apologize that I cannot like every reply.  A few asked why I was learning Python at my age.  I'm still working full time, and I believe new skills are always good.  Others asked how my learning was goin.  I watch some of the video, then practice to determine how much I have learned then watch more and practice. My goal is Python certification.  Again, thank you all for your support.",Positive,Positive,True

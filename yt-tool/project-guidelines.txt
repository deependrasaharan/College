In this open-ended project, students are invited to design and implement an innovative NLP application leveraging the capabilities of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, BERT, T5, or LLaMA. The goal is to explore how LLMs can be fine-tuned, prompted, or integrated into real-world tasks to enhance language understanding, generation, or reasoning. You may choose any problem domain such as text summarization, sentiment analysis, chatbot development, question answering, fake news detection, code generation, translation, or document classification. Begin by identifying a clear research or application problem, collecting or selecting an appropriate dataset (public datasets from Hugging Face, Kaggle, or other sources are recommended), and defining measurable objectives. Implement preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and text normalization, followed by model experimentation using pretrained or fine-tuned LLMs. Evaluate model performance using metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, accuracy, F1-score, or perplexity, depending on your task. The final submission should include your code, dataset description, experimental analysis, and a concise report highlighting the motivation, methodology, results, and implications of your work. Creativity, originality, and practical application of LLMs in solving real-world NLP challenges will be key evaluation criteria.
